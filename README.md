# RFPUNA1.0
Based on the Random Forest structure proposed by Baez et al. (2020), the first version of the local daily gridded product of precipitation and temperature in the Chile-Argentina Puna area (21-27°S and 64-69.5°W) is presented: RFPUNA1.0. This product combines information from global gridded products, physiographic features and field measurements to achieve more accurate estimates, with a resolution of 0.05° x 0.05°. 

The codes and input data for a simulation in the year 2010 are presented here.
